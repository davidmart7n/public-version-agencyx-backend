## üîê What‚Äôs been removed

To ensure security and protect internal business logic, the following have been **excluded**:

- Environment variables and config files (`application.properties`, `application.yaml`)
- Authentication and security logic (JWT, Firebase Auth, user roles, filters)
- Business-critical services and logic (e.g., Firestore integration, FCM, AI modules)
- Internal endpoints and private REST APIs

- Offer a **transparent view** of the backend's modular and scalable architecture.
